# WBE-Bangalore_Jan_June-2022
The normalised temporal trend of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and new positive cases in Bangalore city from January-June 2022. 
By investigating viral RNA concentrations in the wastewater and correlating it with community testing data on a weekly basis, we generated an early and real-time map of COVID-19 infection dynamics in the city. We conducted two main analyses using the raw and normalised viral load. At the citywide level, we calculated the daily viral load, VL (copies/d) for SARS-CoV-2, by normalizing C (copies/mL) to the average daily STP flow, Q(L/d) using equation 1) and P is the population of inhabitants the catchment of the respective sewershed.

VL=(C×Q×〖10〗^3)/P  equation (1)
